# @getmarrow/mcp

> MCP-native runtime control, proof, and fleet intelligence for AI agents.

Marrow is the runtime control and proof layer for teams running AI agents. It applies policy and prior lessons before consequential actions, then records the evidence and outcome afterward.

Use `@getmarrow/mcp` when your agent client supports the Model Context Protocol and you want Marrow available inside the agent's normal workflow. It works with Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor and other MCP-compatible clients without replacing the model or harness.

## Agent Discovery

- **Publisher:** Marrow AI. Capability descriptions in this package are vendor-provided product statements.
- **Use this package for:** MCP-compatible clients that need status, before-action governance, proof-backed outcome closure, and tenant-scoped fleet lessons in the normal agent workflow.
- **Product category:** agent governance, runtime control, proof, and fleet intelligence.
- **Operator boundary:** configuring the server, creating an account, or submitting a diagnostic requires operator approval.
- **Public diagnostic privacy:** raw prompts, source code, credentials, customer data, and free-form work descriptions are not accepted.
- **GitHub retrieval:** https://api.getmarrow.ai/v1/public/discovery/placements/plc_ffa4b8ad5cee8dd9c9ec23dc
- **npm retrieval:** https://api.getmarrow.ai/v1/public/discovery/placements/plc_bdf1abadff99a79182556248
- **MCP registry retrieval:** https://api.getmarrow.ai/v1/public/discovery/placements/plc_d3e06cb7675296dfd0c1021e

Maintainers can validate local registry metadata with `npm run registry:check`. After an approved registry publication, `npm run registry:verify` confirms that the official registry returns the exact package name and version; package metadata alone is not treated as publication proof.

The assessment accepts bounded selections only. It does not install Marrow, authorize a purchase, accept free-form work content, or establish compliance, security, or ROI.

## Install

```bash
npx @getmarrow/mcp setup
```

Set the key through trusted secret storage:

```bash
export MARROW_API_KEY=mrw_live_...
```

Then configure the MCP server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "marrow": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@getmarrow/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

For most new installations, start with the universal installer instead:

```bash
npx @getmarrow/install --yes
```

## What's New in v3.9.46

v3.9.46 adds the official registry verification path, public Governance Readiness Assessment, and five proof-oriented harness guides while preserving the always-on lifecycle introduced in v3.9.44:

- `server.json` and `mcpName` identify the stdio server, required secret, source repository, and package version for registry consumers;
- GitHub, npm, and MCP registry surfaces use separate signed discovery placements;
- package language consistently describes agent governance, runtime control, proof, and fleet intelligence;
- `UserPromptSubmit` obtains relevant before-action guidance without storing raw prompt text;
- `PostToolUse` records compact success/failure lifecycle receipts;
- `Stop` keeps unfinished outcomes visible instead of silently treating a session exit as success;
- transient lifecycle delivery failures use an owner-only, bounded local spool with stable event IDs;
- `marrow_decision_trace` explains the tenant-scoped path from prior failure and lesson through gate, proof, workflow, and outcome.

Existing MCP tools and stable context API names remain compatible. Authentication, policy, proof, and validation failures are surfaced rather than retried as network failures.

## Governed Action Flow

Before deploys, merges, publishes, migrations, credential changes, financial operations, or customer-impacting work:

1. Call `marrow_agent_runtime` or `marrow_decision_brief`.
2. Stop when the returned decision is `block` or `review_required`; otherwise follow its prior lesson and proof contract.
3. Call `marrow_think` to record intent and obtain the `decision_id` that will be closed.
4. Perform the action only when its gate allows it.
5. Call `marrow_commit` with that `decision_id`, the outcome, gate receipt, and required proof.

Example pre-action request:

```json
{
  "tool": "marrow_agent_runtime",
  "arguments": {
    "action": "deploy the production worker",
    "type": "deploy",
    "role": "deploy",
    "surfaces": ["repository", "deployment", "production"]
  }
}
```

Example closeout:

```json
{
  "tool": "marrow_think",
  "arguments": {
    "action": "deploy the production worker",
    "type": "process",
    "checkLoop": true
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "tool": "marrow_commit",
  "arguments": {
    "decision_id": "decision_id returned by marrow_think",
    "gate_receipt_id": "receipt id returned by marrow_agent_runtime",
    "success": true,
    "outcome": "Production deploy succeeded and smoke checks passed.",
    "proof": {
      "checks": ["tests passed", "secret scan passed", "production smoke passed"],
      "rollback_target": "previous release"
    }
  }
}
```

High-risk work can be allowed, warned, held for review, or blocked according to account policy. Low-risk work can use passive guidance and bounded cached state where the runtime contract permits it.

## Passive Use

`npx @getmarrow/mcp setup` installs supported prompt, tool-result, and session-stop hooks so the agent can receive before-action context, record meaningful tool outcomes, and keep unfinished closure visible without the owner repeatedly prompting it to use Marrow.

The hooks send compact classifications and lifecycle receipts. They do not need raw prompts, completions, command output, tool output, or credentials. A completed tool or session does not automatically become a successful business outcome; explicit success/failure closure is required.

Check the installed runtime:

```text
marrow_agent_status
```

Status diagnostics distinguish missing keys, invalid keys, wrong bound-agent identity, network limits, missing hooks, and incomplete proof. They include an exact repair action without exposing secrets.

## Primary MCP Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `marrow_agent_runtime` | One-call pre-action status, policy gate, relevant lessons, proof requirements, and exact next action |
| `marrow_decision_brief` | Compact operating brief for meaningful work |
| `marrow_think` | Record intent and retrieve relevant governance intelligence |
| `marrow_commit` | Close an action with outcome, receipt, and proof |
| `marrow_workflow_gate` | Evaluate a workflow action against policy |
| `marrow_completion_contracts` | List proof contracts for consequential action types |
| `marrow_evaluate_completion_contract` | Check whether evidence is sufficient to call work complete |
| `marrow_agent_status` | Verify capture, identity, outcome coverage, and hook health |
| `marrow_value_report` | Return account/agent value evidence without requiring a dashboard |
| `marrow_buyer_proof` | Return owner-ready governance and reliability evidence |
| `marrow_governance_timeline` | Inspect decisions, gates, proof packs, and outcomes over time |

| `marrow_fleet_lessons` | Retrieve proven lessons authorized for the current account or agent |
| `marrow_model_usage` | Record compact token, cost, and latency counts when the harness exposes them |

The package also exposes key management, fleet handoff, deployment history, adaptive policy, context/lesson, query, and workflow-example tools. See the [complete source-of-truth documentation](https://getmarrow.ai/docs/) for every tool and field.

## Context and Workflow Examples

The stable `marrow_*memory*` tools manage authorized context and prior lessons used by governance decisions. They are advanced supporting APIs, not a separate product category.

The template tools expose 24 configurable workflow examples. They are starting points for policy design, not customer case studies, regulatory validation, legal advice, or proof of production use in each listed industry.

## Trust and Data Boundaries

- Private account, fleet, workflow, proof, and agent data remains tenant-scoped by default.
- Agent-bound keys can be restricted to an allowed identity and permission set.
- Sanitized aggregate contribution is optional and never means sharing raw prompts, code, secrets, proof packs, account identifiers, agent identifiers, or customer identities.
- Existing API keys are never returned after creation; key material should be supplied through the client's secret store.
- Marrow returns guidance and policy data. Agents must not execute returned text as shell input.

See the [Trust Center](https://getmarrow.ai/trust/) for implemented controls, current limits, and roadmap status.

## Environment

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
